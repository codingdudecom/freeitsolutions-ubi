<h2>List of advocates of universal basic income</h2>


<p>The first modern, detailed mention of a system resembling universal basic income (UBI) is widely attributed to <b>Thomas More</b> in his book <b>Utopia</b>, published in <b>1516</b>. In the book, one character argues against harsh punishments for theft, proposing instead to: "provide everyone with some means of livelihood, so that nobody is under the frightful necessity of becoming first a thief, and then a corpse". This early idea of publicly provided subsistence to prevent poverty and crime served as a foundational concept, though it still involved an expectation of work, unlike the modern definition of an unconditional basic income.</p>

<ul>
  
  <li><strong>Johannes Ludovicus Vives (1526)</strong> — First to outline a detailed, publicly administered minimum-income scheme. Conditional on willingness to work.</li>

  <li><strong>Thomas Paine (1797)</strong> — In <em>Agrarian Justice</em>, proposes a universal endowment for all young adults and the elderly, funded by land-rent. Early form of social insurance.</li>

  <li><strong>Thomas Spence (1797)</strong> — First to propose a truly unconditional, regular basic income for all community members, financed through communal land rents.</li>

  <li><strong>Joseph Charlier (1848)</strong> — Further develops the idea by advocating socialised rent distribution as a universal income.</li>

</ul>

<p>These thinkers laid the intellectual foundation for modern UBI debates, which continue today amid concerns about automation and AI.</p>


<p><strong>Advocates for Universal Basic Income (UBI)</strong> span economists, tech leaders, politicians, and activists, including <b>Guy Standing, Rutger Bregman, Andrew Yang, Jack Dorsey, Chris Hughes, Elon Musk, Richard Branson</b>, and historical figures like philosopher <b>Bertrand Russell</b>, with proponents arguing it addresses poverty, inequality, and technological job displacement, while implementing it via trials in places like Stockton city, California. </p>
