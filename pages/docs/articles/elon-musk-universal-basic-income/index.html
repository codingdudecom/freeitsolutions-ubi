<h2>Who is Elon Musk</h2>

<h2>“There’s a pretty good chance we end up with a universal basic income.” ... “I think UBI will be necessary.” - Elon Musk</h2>

<p>Advocates for Universal Basic Income (UBI) span economists, tech leaders, politicians, and activists, including Guy Standing, Rutger Bregman, Andrew Yang, Jack Dorsey, Chris Hughes, Elon Musk, Richard Branson, and historical figures like philosopher Bertrand Russell, with proponents arguing it addresses poverty, inequality, and technological job displacement, while implementing it via trials in places like Stockton, CA. </p>


<h3>⭐ Elon Musk – Entrepreneur (Tesla, SpaceX, xAI)</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Why he’s associated with UBI:</strong> Publicly stated multiple times that UBI will likely become necessary due to automation and AI eliminating many jobs.</li> <li><strong>Mention date:</strong> Frequently discussed from 2016 onward, especially in interviews and tech conferences.</li> </ul>

<p>Elon Musk made statements about AI and robotics making money “irrelevant” during his conversations with Joe Rogan, including discussions in 2023–2024. </p>
<ul>
  <li>He emphasized that advanced AI and humanoid robots (such as Tesla’s Optimus) could eventually perform all human work.</li>
  <li>If all labor becomes automated, traditional money systems may lose their meaning.</li>
  <li>In such a scenario, governments might provide everyone with universal basic income.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Elon Musk and Universal Basic Income</h2>

<h2>Musk’s Statements on UBI</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Musk has repeatedly said UBI will become <strong>“necessary”</strong> as automation increases.</li>
  <li>In a 2016 interview, he stated there is a <strong>“pretty good chance we end up with universal basic income.”</strong></li>
  <li>He frames UBI as a practical, inevitable response to technological disruption.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Musk Supports UBI (Automation & AI)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Automation will replace many human jobs across industries.</li>
  <li>AI systems and humanoid robots could eventually perform both manual and skilled labor.</li>
  <li>Without UBI, Musk believes society may face economic instability and inequality.</li>
  <li>Musk often refers to Tesla’s Optimus robot as evidence that most physical labor may be automated.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quotes From Interviews</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“There really will be no choice but to have some kind of UBI.”</strong></li>
  <li><strong>“If machines can do almost any job, we need a plan for what people will do.”</strong></li>
  <li><strong>“Automation will make a lot of jobs irrelevant.”</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Comparison to Other Tech Leaders</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sam Altman:</strong> Strong advocate; funds UBI pilots and crypto-based initiatives.</li>
  <li><strong>Mark Zuckerberg:</strong> Supports experimenting with UBI to foster creativity and equality.</li>
  <li><strong>Bill Gates:</strong> More cautious; prefers targeted aid over universal payments.</li>
  </ul>

 <p>Musk is typically more urgent and deterministic about the need for UBI.</p>

  <li><strong>2017–2019:</strong> public statements calling UBI “necessary” amid AI warnings.</li>
  <li><strong>2020–2023:</strong> Ties Tesla robotics and AI development directly to future job loss.</li>
  <li><strong>2024–present:</strong> Continues predicting robots will perform “almost everything,” making UBI essential.</li>
</ul>
